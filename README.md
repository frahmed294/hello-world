My name is Farah Ahmed, and I am 24 years old. I am originally from Illinois but moved to California and have lived here for 14 years. I have a bachelor's in Molecular and Cell Biology and am pursuing a master's in Data Science at Boston University after being introduced to Python in a neurobiology course. My hobbies include painting, sketching, cooking, and reading. I am excited to continue my academic journey as I shift towards the field of data science.
